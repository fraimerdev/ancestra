When the early British settlers arrived in the 17th century, they immediately noticed the strong sulfur aroma emanating from the volcanic stone - what they called 'brimstone,' which is the ancient English term for sulfur.\n\nThis sulfur scent was so prominent that it became the hill's defining characteristic, giving birth to its name. Interestingly, this same volcanic rock - formed from ancient eruptions - proved to be incredibly durable and perfect for fortress construction, which is why the British chose this strategic location for their 'Gibraltar of the West Indies.'\n\nThe name perfectly captures both the geological wonder and the formidable presence of this magnificent fortress!
